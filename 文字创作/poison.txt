[Verse]

Em D C
Who would've thought love could paralyze
D Em D C
stuck in a lust we can't deny
D Em D Am C
drifting away to this vacant high

[Pre-Chorus]

Am
Oh, it's a sick thing
Bm
it's deadly
C D
it's leading me to my grave

[Chorus]

C G
I'm craving you baby, yeah you're so close to me
D Em
a bite of your apple is all that I need
C G D Em D
you're like poison, you're like poison
C G
I look in your eyes and I'm numb to the touch
D Em
a taste of your venom it's all just too much
C G D Em D
you're like poison, you're my poison

[Verse]

Em D C
I took a lethal dose of you
D Em D C
did what I swore I'd never do

[Pre-Chorus]

Am
Oh, You're a sick thing
Bm
You're deadly
C D
You're leading me to my grave

[Chorus]

C G
I'm craving you baby, yeah you're so close to me
D Em
a bite of your apple is all that I need
C G D Em D
you're like poison, you're like poison
C G
I look in your eyes and I'm numb to the touch
D Em
a taste of your venom it's all just too much
C G D Em D
you're like poison, you're my poison

[Bridge] () = Uncertain

C D Em Em
The room is spinning, I'm out of my head
C D Em C
tried to get up but my heartbeat's a mess, oh
D Em
and I can't see past these warning signs
(C) D
but I don't care, at least not for tonight

[Chorus]

C G
I'm craving you baby, yeah you're so close to me
D Em
a bite of your apple is all that I need
C G D Em D
you're like poison, you're like poison
C G
I look in your eyes and I'm numb to the touch
D Em
a taste of your venom it's all just too much
C G D Em D
you're like poison, you're my poison
